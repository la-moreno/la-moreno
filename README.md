# Lucas Moreno 
Hi! Iâ€™m Lucas, a video game programmer and designer who specializes in writing clean and scalable code. In 2020 I graduated from Texas State Technical College, earning an Associate of Applied Science in Graphics, Gaming and Simulation Programming Technology.

I am currently building on my academic foundations with personal projects and self guided learning. I am very passionate about learning new things and taking on complicated challenges. Check out some of my recent projects to get an idea of my skills and capabilities as a programmer and designer.
